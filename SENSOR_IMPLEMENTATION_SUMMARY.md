# External Sensors Implementation Summary
 
## Overview

Added comprehensive support for external temperature and humidity sensors to AI-on-the-edge-device, enabling device health and safety monitoring - especially critical for outdoor installations.

## Implemented Features

### Supported Sensors
1. **SHT3x** (I²C) - Temperature (-40°C to +125°C) and Humidity (0-100% RH)
2. **DS18B20** (1-Wire) - Temperature (-55°C to +125°C), chainable with full ROM search support

### Integration Points
- ✅ GPIO configuration via existing [GPIO] section (new modes: i2c-sda, i2c-scl, onewire)
- ✅ Dedicated [SHT3x] and [DS18B20] configuration sections
- ✅ MQTT publishing with configurable topics (includes ROM IDs for DS18B20)
- ✅ InfluxDB logging for trending (includes ROM IDs for DS18B20)
- ✅ "Follow flow" mode (interval = -1) or custom intervals
- ✅ Full web UI configuration
- ✅ **Multi-DS18B20 support with ROM search** - automatically discovers all sensors on the bus

### Architecture
- New `jomjol_sensors` component with modular design
- `ClassFlowSensors` integrated into flow control architecture
- Automatic GPIO pin detection from configuration
- Native I²C driver (ESP-IDF) with CRC validation
- Bit-banging 1-Wire implementation with ROM search (no external dependencies)
- Standard Dallas/Maxim 1-Wire ROM search algorithm for device discovery

## Configuration Example

```ini
# Step 1: Configure GPIO pins for sensors
[GPIO]
IO12 = i2c-sda          # I²C data line
IO13 = i2c-scl          # I²C clock line

# Step 2: Configure SHT3x sensor
[SHT3x]
Enable = true
Address = 0x44
Interval = -1            # Follow main flow cycle
I2C_Frequency = 100000
MQTT_Enable = true
MQTT_Topic = enclosure/climate
InfluxDB_Enable = true
InfluxDB_Measurement = environment

# Step 3: Configure DS18B20 sensor (optional)
[DS18B20]
Enable = true
Interval = 300           # Read every 5 minutes
MQTT_Enable = true
MQTT_Topic = enclosure/temperature
InfluxDB_Enable = false
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Device Health Monitoring
Monitor enclosure conditions to prevent failures:
- **Temperature**: Detect overheating before component damage
- **Humidity**: Prevent condensation and corrosion
- **Trends**: Identify degrading conditions early

### 2. Outdoor Installation Safety
Critical for weather-exposed devices:
- Solar heating detection and mitigation
- Freeze protection for winter operation
- Rain/moisture ingress detection
- Extreme weather alerts

### 3. Multi-Point Temperature Monitoring
Chain multiple DS18B20 sensors for:
- Inside vs. outside enclosure comparison
- Thermal gradient analysis
- Cooling system effectiveness verification
- Component-specific temperature tracking

### 4. Predictive Maintenance
Use historical data for:
- Scheduled maintenance based on trends
- Seal replacement before failure
- Ventilation optimization
- Early warning before thermal shutdown

## Alert Thresholds

Recommended monitoring limits:

| Metric | Good Range | Warning | Critical |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|
| Enclosure Temp | 0-50°C | 50-65°C | >65°C |
| Enclosure Humidity | 20-60% RH | 60-80% RH | >80% RH |
| Ambient Temp | -20 to +40°C | Outside range | Extremes |
| Temp Delta (In-Out) | <15°C | 15-25°C | >25°C |

## MQTT Integration

### SHT3x Output
```
enclosure/climate/temperature → 24.5
enclosure/climate/humidity → 45.2
```

### DS18B20 Output (Single)

enclosure/temperature → 28.3
```

### DS18B20 Output (Multiple - with ROM IDs)
```
enclosure/temperature/28-0123456789AB → 28.5  (inside)
enclosure/temperature/28-FEDCBA987654 → 15.2  (outside)

```

## Real-World Failure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Solar Overheating
**Problem**: Device resets during hot summer afternoons  
**Detection**: Temperature spikes to 75°C daily at 2 PM  
**Solution**: Added ventilation holes, relocated to shaded area  
**Result**: Temperature now peaks at 55°C, no more resets  

### Scenario 2: Winter Condensation
**Problem**: Corrosion on PCB after 6 months  
**Detection**: Humidity sustained at 85% during winter  
**Solution**: Added desiccant pack, improved enclosure seal  
**Result**: Humidity drops to 45%, device lifespan extended  

### Scenario 3: Cooling Fan Failure
**Problem**: Unknown if fan working after 2 years  
**Detection**: Temperature delta increasing (18°C → 28°C)  
**Solution**: Replaced fan, cleaned dust buildup  
**Result**: Delta returns to 12°C, normal operation  

### Scenario 4: Pipe Freeze
**Problem**: Water meter pipe burst in winter  
**Detection**: DS18B20 on pipe shows <0°C for 4 hours  
**Solution**: Added trace heating activated at <2°C  
**Result**: Pipe temperature maintained >5°C, no freeze

## Known Limitations

1. **1-Wire Blocking**: DS18B20 reading blocks for ~800ms (conversion + read time)
   - Impact: Minimal on typical 5-10 minute flow cycles
   - Note: Custom intervals now properly supported via background task (fixed in latest version)

2. **GPIO Pins**: Limited to IO1, IO3, IO12, IO13
   - Impact: Other GPIOs may conflict with camera/SD
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation of safe pins

3. **No Auto-Discovery**: Home Assistant discovery not implemented
   - Impact: Manual sensor configuration required
   - Workaround: Example YAML provided in docs
   - Future: Add MQTT discovery messages

## Recent Improvements

### Custom Interval Support (Latest Version)

**Problem Solved:** Previously, sensors with custom intervals shorter than the flow interval were not read at their specified rate.

**Solution:** Implemented a background FreeRTOS task that:
- Runs every 1 second independently of main flow
- Checks and reads sensors based on their individual intervals
- Allows high-frequency monitoring (e.g., every 5 seconds) even with long flow intervals (e.g., 5 minutes)
- Minimal performance impact (4KB memory, low CPU usage)

**Example:**
```ini
[AutoTimer]
Interval = 5        ; Flow every 5 minutes

[DS18B20]
Interval = 5        ; Sensor read every 5 seconds
```
Result: Sensor now correctly reads every 5 seconds, producing ~60 readings per flow cycle.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Sensors**: BME280, BME680, DHT22, AHT20
2. **HA Discovery**: Automatic Home Assistant entity creation
3. **Async 1-Wire**: Non-blocking DS18B20 reads
4. **Sensor Calibration**: Offset/scaling configuration
5. **Alert System**: Built-in threshold alerts (email/webhook)
6. **Data Retention**: Local SD card logging
7. **Graphing**: Built-in web UI graphs
